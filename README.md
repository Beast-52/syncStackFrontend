# Sync Stack

Sync Stack is a web application that allows users to connect with each other based on their interests. The application is built using React, Redux, and Node.js.

## Features

* User authentication and authorization
* User profiles with ability to add bio, skills, and interests
* Ability to connect with other users based on interests
* Ability to ignore users
* Ability to view all users in the application
* Ability to view all connections a user has made

## How it Works

1. A user signs up for an account and creates a profile.
2. The user can then add their interests to their profile.
3. When a user views another user's profile, they can choose to connect with that user based on their interests.
4. If the other user accepts the connection, the users are connected.
5. A user can view all of their connections on their profile page.
6. A user can also view all of the users in the application on the connections page.
7. A user can choose to ignore another user, which will prevent them from seeing that user's profile.
